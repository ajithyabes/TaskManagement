Task Management API

## Time Spent
Approximate time spent (in minutes): 120 minutes (2 hours)
## Approach
I saw the instructions it says In-memory storage only. But for better readablility I'm using DB and Entity Framework core.
- Used Depemdency injection to maintain loosely coupled between classses.
- Add most of te validation in request model itself. So, the request is case sesitive.
- Creation of a DB & table script is included under scripts folder.
## Trade-offs
What would you improve with more time?
- Missed Fluent Validators.
- Missed unit test cases
